## Experimental Digital Forensic Workflow Server
OpenRelik is an open-source (Apache-2.0) platform designed to streamline collaborative digital forensic investigations. It combines modular workflows for custom investigative processes, an intuitive interface for efficient workflow management, real-time collaboration features, and a centralized repository for shared artifacts. The platform is easy to extend with new workers to adapt to evolving forensic needs.

##### Obligatory Fine Print
This is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is just code that happens to be owned by Google.
